  <h1>This is my homepage!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Niko! I'm currently studying Computer Science at university of Helsinki.
    This page is just a test at the moment, but I will propably add more content here
    sometime soon...</p>
  <p>One point of this page is that I am trying to learn CSS and try to see how
    much I can do by just using styles in css and without any readymade tools etc.
    (Twitter Bootstrap etc.), so the site might be a little ugly, sorry about that :(
  </p>

  <p>In case you are wondering what types of projects I have done so far here
    are some:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/nikomn/tiralabra-pakkausalgoritmit">Data compression program</a></li>
        <div>Program designed to compress text files using huffman coding and/or lzw compression.

      <li><a href="https://github.com/nikomn/ot-harjoitustyo">Studytime Tracker</a>

          can be tested <a href="https://itemindex-demo.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
            (will propably shut it down sometime in the future as I can only have
