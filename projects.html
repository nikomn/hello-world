<p>During my studies I have also participated in two software production projects as 
  a member of team using Scrum methods:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nikomn/Kierratysavustin">"Recycling assistant app" (Kotitalouden kierr√§tysavustin)</a></li>
      <div>A larger project done during january to may of 2021. Team had 6 members. Weekly work hours were 
        ~15 hours / week for each member of the team. The link is for a fork in of the project
        in my own github, since the project is likely to be continued later with another team.
        The original repo of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/ohtuprojekti-Kierratysavustin/Kierratysavustin">here</a>
      </div>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/nikomn/Lukuvinkkikirjasto-Napsa">"Reading tips library app" (Lukuvinkkikirjasto-Napsa)</a></li>
      <div>A mini project done during three weeks during december of 2020. Team had 5 members. Weekly work hours were 
        ~6 hours / week for each member of the team. The link is for a fork in of the project in my 
        own github, since the original project is one team members personal repo and might 
        get deleted at some point.
        The original repo of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/VirtualAkseli/Lukuvinkkikirjasto-Napsa">here</a>
      </div>
  </ul>

  <p>I am currently planning on doing a larger FullStack programming project during 
    the summer of 2021 as part of my studies. The project will be written 
    in JavaScript with React and the topic will most likely be some sort of Scrum 
    project management app. So stay tuned... :)
